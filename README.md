Project: Subnet Creation



Objective:To create a subnet both private and public and configuring the settings



-I logged into my AWS management console.



-Navigated to the VPC services



-Clicked subnets.



-I clicked on create



-Tagged it my “subnet project”



-I selected the default VPC.



-I inserted the subnet CIDR block.



-I clicked on create.



-I then repeated the process for the creation of a public subnet.



-For the public subnet after creation, I have to go to action then edit settings.



-In the edit settings I checked “auto assign public ipv4 address”



-That made the subnet public.



The project gave me an insight into the subnet services and I have learnt a lot about.
